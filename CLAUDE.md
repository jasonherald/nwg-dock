# CLAUDE.md — nwg-dock

## What is this?

A macOS-style dock for Hyprland and Sway, written in Rust. Renamed from `nwg-dock-hyprland` at v0.3.0 because the Rust port supports both compositors through one binary (Compositor trait + runtime `--wm` auto-detection), so the compositor-specific name stopped fitting. A `nwg-dock-hyprland` symlink alias is installed by `make install` so existing autostart lines keep working.

Consumes [`nwg-common`](https://github.com/jasonherald/nwg-common) for compositor IPC, `.desktop` parsing, pin-file management, CSS hot-reload, and signal plumbing.

Pre-split (before v0.3.0) this lived inside the [mac-doc-hyprland](https://github.com/jasonherald/mac-doc-hyprland) monorepo at `crates/nwg-dock/` with `[[bin]].name = "nwg-dock-hyprland"`; that repo's git log has the full pre-0.3.0 history.

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build                   # Debug build
cargo build --release         # Release build
cargo test                    # Unit tests
cargo clippy --all-targets    # Lint (should be zero warnings)
cargo fmt --all               # Format
make test                     # Unit tests + clippy
make test-integration         # Headless Sway integration tests (requires sway, foot)
make lint                     # Full check: fmt + clippy + test + deny + audit
```

Per [tests/integration/CLASSIFICATION.md](https://github.com/jasonherald/mac-doc-hyprland/blob/main/tests/integration/CLASSIFICATION.md) in the monorepo, this repo owns the dock-binary-launch smoke test plus the shared Sway bootstrap scaffolding; the Sway IPC + window-management tests live in `nwg-common`.

## Install (dev workflow)

**Use the no-sudo invocation when iterating locally from a clone.** The Makefile's default target is system-wide (`sudo make install` → `/usr/local/bin`); during development you almost certainly want:

```bash
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local BINDIR=$HOME/.cargo/bin
```

This drops `nwg-dock` in `~/.cargo/bin/` without touching `/usr/local`. Rerun after code changes; `make upgrade` rebuilds + reinstalls + restarts in one shot. See the README for the end-user install matrix (default / no-sudo / distro-parity).

## Run locally

```bash
# Basic — auto-hide, 48px icons, translucent
nwg-dock -d -i 48 --mb 10 --hide-timeout 400

# With launch animation + drawer integration
nwg-dock -d -i 48 --mb 10 --hide-timeout 400 --launch-animation -c "nwg-drawer --pb-auto"

# Force Sway backend (auto-detection is usually enough)
nwg-dock --wm sway

# Legacy name — symlink, same behavior
nwg-dock-hyprland -d -i 48 --mb 10
```

## Conventions

- **Enums over strings** — Position, Alignment, Layer are all `clap::ValueEnum` or repr enums.
- **Named constants** — all UI dimensions in `ui/constants.rs`.
- **DockContext** — bundles config/state/data_home/pinned_file/rebuild/compositor for clean function signatures; never pass 7+ individual refs.
- **Compositor trait only** — all WM IPC goes through `nwg_common::compositor::Compositor`. No direct hyprland or sway calls anywhere in this crate.
- **No `#[allow(dead_code)]`** — all code is used.
- **No magic numbers** — every numeric literal has a named constant or clear inline comment.
- **Error handling** — log errors, never silently discard with `let _ =`.
- **Unsafe** — none in this crate; the dock relies on `nwg_common::signals` for the RT-signal unsafe bits.
- **Tests** — `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at bottom of file, test behavior not implementation.

## State borrowing conventions

The dock shares `Rc<RefCell<DockState>>` across ~80+ borrow sites in the UI handlers. The pattern is load-bearing — several handlers explicitly `drop(s)` a `RefMut` before calling `rebuild()`, and the reentrancy guard in `rebuild.rs` (the `running` / `pending` `Cell<bool>` pair plus the "glycin pumping the main loop" comment inside the rebuild closure) exists because nested borrows of state via the rebuild closure caused real crashes in earlier versions.

**Rules — follow them whenever you add or modify a UI handler:**

1. **Drop before rebuild.** Any mutator that calls `rebuild()` must `drop(state)` first. The natural placement is `drop(s);` immediately before the `rebuild()` call. Forgetting this produces a `BorrowMutError` panic on a code path that looks harmless in isolation.

2. **Deferred unborrow via `idle_add_local_once`.** When a call site can't drop the borrow synchronously (e.g. the borrow is inside a match arm that calls an async method), schedule the rebuild for the next idle tick with `glib::idle_add_local_once(move || rebuild_fn())` instead of calling it inline.

3. **Read into locals, then drop.** When in doubt: read the values you need out of state into local variables, let the borrow drop (implicitly or with an explicit `drop(s)`), then call methods or fire rebuilds.

**Diagnosing a `BorrowError` or `BorrowMutError` panic:** the call chain is what matters. Find the path that re-enters state (e.g. a GTK signal handler triggered by `rebuild()` that itself borrows state), then apply rule 1 or 2 to the outermost borrow site.

## Key patterns

### GTK4 button layout

GTK4 has no `set_image`/`set_image_position`. Use a vertical Box:

```rust
let vbox = Box::new(Orientation::Vertical, 4);
vbox.append(&image);
vbox.append(&label);
button.set_child(Some(&vbox));
```

Canonical pattern: `ui::buttons::pinned_button` (and similarly `task_button` and
`launcher_button`) — they all build the `Button (with Image child) + indicator`
shape inline. App names live on tooltips via `set_tooltip_text`, not visible
labels. The common shape is not yet extracted into a
`ui::widgets::app_icon_button()` helper; that's the optional follow-up in the
review doc, not a current API.

### Self-referential rebuild

The dock rebuild function needs to pass itself to buttons (for pin/unpin rebuild). Uses `Weak` reference to avoid Rc cycle. See `rebuild.rs`.

### Cursor-based autohide

Uses compositor IPC cursor position polling (Hyprland `j/cursorpos`). Cached monitor list refreshed every ~10s. The implementation lives under `ui/hotspot/` — `mod.rs` coordinates, `cursor_poller.rs` owns the Hyprland path, `hotspot_windows.rs` owns the Sway fallback (GTK hotspot surfaces, since Sway has no cursor-position IPC).

### Drag-to-reorder

GTK4 DragSource on each pinned button (including running apps), single DropTarget on the dock box. Cursor poller tracks `drag_outside_dock` state for unpin-by-drag-off. Preview icon cached to avoid glycin reentrancy crashes. Rebuilds deferred via `idle_add_local_once`. Lock state persisted in `~/.cache/nwg-dock-locked`. See `ui/drag.rs` and `ui/dock_menu.rs`.

## Shared pin file

`~/.cache/mac-dock-pinned` (contract defined in `nwg_common::pinning`). Shared with the drawer; changes detected via inotify for instant sync. Right-click a dock icon → Pin/Unpin. Drag an icon off the dock to unpin.

## CSS path

`~/.config/nwg-dock-hyprland/style.css` — path kept for continuity with the Go predecessor. Live hot-reload via `nwg_common::config::css::watch_css`; edit the file and the dock picks up changes without restart. `@import` graph walked to 32 levels, cycles detected.
